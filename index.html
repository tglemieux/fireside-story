    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>A man was walking down the side of the road.</p>
    <p>He opened his umbrella, only for a strong gust to force it from his hands.</p>
    <p>He shook his head and laughed. It was just his luck.</p>
    <p>He picked up his pace to catch up with his lost equipment, when he heard a clack behind him.</p>
